System Billing_App_v5 "BillingSystem (Application Level)" : Application [ isFinal   
  description 
"
BillingSystem is a system that allows users to manage customers, products and invoices. 
A user of the system is someone that has a user account and is assigned to user roles, such as operator, manager and administrator.

User-administrator shall be responsible for managing users, configuring technical features (e.g., user roles, export configuration parameters, 
general enterprise information). System shall allow user-administrator to register users. During this process the administrator shall specify 
first and last name of the user, email address, and username. User password shall be automatically generated by the system and sent to its user email.

User-operator is responsible for managing customers and invoices. User-operator shall create/update information related to customers and invoices. 
For each customer the system shall maintain the following information: name, fiscal id, logo image, address, bank information and additional information 
such as basic person contact information. System shall allow user-operator to define some customers as VIP. If a customer is defined as VIP, for each of her invoice, 
the system shall allow user-operator to set a predefined discount tax. That amount of discount can change throughout the time and depends on 
the current policy of the company. For each product the system shall maintain the following information: name, description, price, VAT category, and VAT value. 
Product must have only one VAT category and maintain the respective current VAT value.

User-operator shall create new invoices (with respective invoice details). However, before sending an invoice to a customer, the invoice shall be formally approved 
by the user-manager. Only after such approval, the user-operator shall issue and send that invoice electronically by e-mail and by regular post. In addition, 
for each invoice, the user-operator needs to keep track if it is paid or not. 

The System shall automatically alert the user-manager, for all the invoices that were sent to customers but not yet paid, after 30 days of their respective issue date.  
In the beginning of each year the System shall archive and send to the ERP-System all paid invoices of the last year. [...]
